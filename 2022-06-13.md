# GOTO 2022 Day 1

## Opening & Introduction

First conference at 2011, this year is the 10 year anniversary. 
A hand of speaker from the first conference are speaking this year again.
Some of the talks should be revised on the youtube channel.

## Rediscovering Humanity in Tech

by Eric Johnson

How we treat each other in tech.
Eric is an developer advocate for AWS.
He initially was a drummer and a dead of 5 kids.
He tells a story about his children: in essence every one want to be valued on a inspiring mission.
We fail a promoting people as valued members.

How to we estimate value? Our own and the value of others.
He tells another story: describes how his values shifts during how is is being handled by turkey customs.
Our value is often assessed by external things.
Some time we value ourselves more than others, but actually we are all equal.
If we don't really think like this we tent to treat others badly.
We overvalue ourselves and think because we are better in things we are a better human, which is not the case.
When you are the smarted in the room, change the room.
If you are the dumbest in the room, you learn the most.

Some times we undervalue ourselves.
He tells another story how he was devalued.
We underestimate the power of words.
Expression of opinions that do no good to anyone should be avoided.
Picking word should be done wisely because they will affect people.
What are the words that get my message across but don't attack.

Social media take away the ability for 3 dimensional discourse.
No one goes to social media to get an opinion but to given one.
Social media is a 2 dimensional conversation.
Body language and context is missing from it.
Choose the right medium for a certain topic.
Controversial topics should not be discussed on social media because it won't work in that medium.

Whats the cost of the words I'm using.
You should not devalue others by trying to constantly to show how smart you are.

Kindness does not always need to mean compromise.
Be nice and kind.
It goes a long way and does not cost much.

Behind every product there are people.

## A tour of the Modern Java Platform

James Ward

What is modern: it a spectrum.
There a small steps and leaps.

Java 11 Features:
* Algebraic Data Types: Sum type & Product Type. 
  Records are Java's Product types `records Point(int x, int y) {}`.
  The immutability helps a lot with multi threading.
  Referential integrity is guarantied.
  Sum type is implemented `sealed interfaces permits ...`, permit are optional for implementation in the same file.
  Allows to pattern match and type inference. 
  Pattern matching is allowing for exhaustive checking.
  Can replace visitor pattern.
* Multi line strings `""" """`
* Nicer NPEs
* Kotlin nullabilty
* Spring Boot with Kotlin
* Test containers
* CoroutineCrudRepository - for a non-blocking access (not JDBC).
  Coroutines can be identified by the `suspend` keyword.
  `Flow` Kotlins non-blocking `Stream`.
* `bootBuildImage` using build-packs.
  Check container image with `dive`.
* GraalVM Native Image to really speed up things, with spring boot already today.
  A warm JIT can be way faster than a AOT image.

## The pipeline driven organization

Roy Osherove

Author of `The Art of Unit-Testing`

Waterfall Pipelines ->  Cooperative Pipelines

There are a lot of automatic pipelines in organization but not as many continuous delivery.
Theory of constrains from the book `The Goal`/`Critical Chain`/`Beyond the Goal`.
Bottlenecks: Permissions, Knowledge, ...
The fours questions:
1. What is the power if the technology?
2. What limitation/restriction/constraint dies is decrease?
3. What rule/processes helped us accommodates the limitation until now?
4. What rules should we use now instead?

Limitations from the manual world:
* time it takes to run tests
* number of environments
* how long did it take to setup to environments
* who knows how to run tests
* ...

We did not know if we could not know in demand to know id the software could be released.
So rules resulting from that:
* run the slow test manually
* only run the tests on one branch
* use code freezes
* only test the new stuff
* release only if QA approves
* having people as gates
* ...

Today we have pipelines, did it help?
Still a lot of people-gates, DEV -> QA -> OPS -> SEC.

What do pipeline offers us:
* endless repeating tests
* endless environments
* ...

New technologies but still the old rules.
Take the people out of the equation.
People should add test into the pipeline to teach the pipeline to make decision.
This will lead to a Coops-Pipeline.

Netflix's journey:
2013 branch per environment.
In 2015 Netflix discussed dynamic pipelines.
Last manually interaction was right before production deployment.
2018 new tool to use automatic metrics analysis to check if deployment is allowed.
First no-human pipeline.
2018 Full cycle developers.
Dev doing every thing in the pipeline.

SDLC 2.0 - software development life cycle the next generation.
The pipeline driven organization.

The pipeline Delegate decides.
The pipeline is a delegate of a person.

Do we trust our pipelines?

In SDLC every one has to contribute.
Ops have to write automated infrastructure tests.
Security also has to write automated security checks.

The pipeline is a big test.

What's in it for everyone?
Less Stress: pipeline is either red or green.
Job Security: every one needed
Organization: less bottlenecks, faster roll outs

The pipeline decides.
We need to trust the pipeline.
We need to teach the pipeline so we can trust it.
Run it every e.g. 3 hours.
Run it on as many environments as possible.

Any manual test needs to be integrated into the pipeline.

If all stages are green we are already in production.
Run on small batches, and use feature toggles.
Use trunk based development.
Never disable parts of the pipeline.
Red pipeline means product is not ready.

## The Zen of Programming

Sander Hoogendoorn

Personal journey into writing code.

Being a travelist. 
Being a codist: those who code to fully experience a new...
It's all about learning.
Shu Ha Ri.
Learn Detach Transcent.
What is Zen: the state of calm attentiveness in which one's... 
You become one with the code, lost at the rhythm of the task at hand.
`Become a techical leader` book.
There are point in time where you suddenly get a lot better.
It's actually not that sudden.
It happens when you learn a new idea.
First it might get worse because it's a experiment.
But it might get a lot better if it succeeds.

> We must learn at any time, place ...

Learning and unlearning.
Start with nothing, then do OO, do OO everywhere, then DD, then abstraction, interface, over abstracting, super simple code.
One is always on a quest.
A quest for very simple code.

Author of the `easy` framework.

In 1994 he started a consultancy.
Programming is like walking in a dessert with poor sight and there might be a wall somewhere you might walk into.
The unknown unknowns.
It's impossible to know every thing.

The end of the `Productivity`, software does not work like this.
Software is hard to quantify.

Code is not about typing stuff.
It about the process in your head.
Kent back said.
> I'm not going too refactor the code yet because the code doesn't know yet where it wants to go.

Programming does not fir well in time boxes.

How does a programmers kind works.
It does not work from 9-5.
Programming can be addictive.

Alistar Cockburn
> Always travel light.

Developers are drawn to complicity, like moth to flames, often with the same result.

> We might need this in the future.

> Eventually we will need this.

> If I write my code more generic now, we will benefit from it later.

> ...

Hofstaders Law

> It always take longer than you expect.

You can only spend you time once.

Do we really need it now.
If we might need it later - DON't DO IT.

Code is not a product, code is cost.
Simpler code is always better.

> easiest code to maintain is no code

Start with returns.
Figure out what should be returned first.

Naming:
Do not put type information into the naming.
Do not repeat class name in functions of that class.

> The mist secure code is no code.

Architecture: 
The Architecture that is most adoptable to change will survive.
Entities, Use cases, Resources, Gateways.

Development is hard.
See JavaScript ecosystem.

CYNEFIN: Complex Complicated Chaotic Obvious.

BYE-BYE-DI.
Can add complexity.
Monadic code can become complex.
When is a test a unit test?
If it can not run in parallel it's not one*.
Test give confidence.
We don't debug our code anymore, we just re-run our tests.

Testing as a design.
Design is the progressive elimination of ambiguity.
Start with the assumption that you are wrong.
Write the test to show that it's write.
Write failure test cases first.
Test code is code too.
It also needs to be maintained.

Whats the tech-stack.

The smallest unit to write code is a team.

Continuous experimentation.

The micro team recipe.
* pick
* form 
* discuss 
* work 
* report as done
* disband 
* repeat

> We did we never go to Italy?

Some people love the change, other don't.
You need both.

You need to ignite the change.
Don't rely on your manager.
Never be afraid to ask the newcomer question.
Take small steps.


## Practical Tips and Tricks for CI/CD Success

Zen Markan

Thought experiment:
You are getting ready to deploy something you works on for couple of weeks.
You only need to press the button.
One pressed the software is rolled out to production.
After deployment you have 2 options:
1. Wait until it blows up
2. You pack up and go home and all is nice

They are not too different.
It all comes down to automation.
This can be applied to agriculture too.
You can do it with a lot of people or you apply machines and git predictable results.
A finely tine CI/CD setup will work the same as a high-tech crop farm.

CI = Continuous Integration.
From code to executable artifact.

CD = Continuous Deployment
Practice of automatic deployment to an environment.

We want to trust it.

Speed.
Time to run a CI/CD pipeline.
Time to run tests.
Time to feed back.
Time to recover from a failing build.
Time to skip a feature.

Running things faster.
Use right sized resources.
Cache everything.
Cache dependencies.
Cache build increments.
Cache build artifacts.
Run jobs and tests in parallel.
Possible run tests suites in parallel.
Think about what to run when.
Do not run everything any time.
It's not a race but more like an ambulance car that has to arrive safely but fast.
Resolve red signals ASAP.

Recover from failure.
Log everything.
Debug as they fail.

That should to it.
Security and Risk Management.
Automate scanning.
Access control.
Who can deploy?

Beyond the CI/CD tool.
Validate changes in production.
Integrate with other tools.

It's not about the technology, it's about the team responsibility.

Broken deployment will happen.
Enable fast recovery & reverts enabled by smaller increments.
Prepare for it, have a run book.

## Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters

Adam Tornhill

Lehmans laws' of software evilution:
* Continuing Change - a system must be continually adapted or it will become progressively less satisfactory.
* Increasing Complicity

Increasing complexity consequences and impact:
Changes take longer and longer.
Lack of predictability.
Organizational problem's and low innovation.
Team might have a high fluctuation.

Quantifying technical debt via static analysis, it's not actionable.
Tech debt can not be prioritized from code alone.
How to prioritize.
Book software design x-rays.
-> Behavior Code Analysis.

Version Control - A Behavior Data Source.

Case Study: Android.
Platform Framework base: 3 millions Lined of Code.
Using the visualization to identify code complexity. 
It also allows for change hot sports.
The intersection of complexity and change need to be identified.
Paper `Complexity Explained`,  there is no single metric to measure complexity.

Code Health: Beyond a single metric.
Example: Low cohesion, Brain Class.

Finding the bad code is easy.
Which ones to fix.
Fix the ones that are hotpots.
Most of the code is really ever touched.
We can live with these tech debt.

Refactoring a hotspot can be a huge risk.
Analyze the hotspot.
Cyclic Complexity tells us about number of unit test minimally required to test it.

Tech Debt and People.
Legacy code is related to tech debt but is not the same.
Code might look like tech debt if it was written in a different team/culture.

How fast can you turn you codebase into legacy code.

Software is filled with power law distributions.
The impact of off-boarding can be visualized via github.
knowledge loss + relevance (hotspot) + impact (code complexity)

Code Complexity is more than code.
Knowledge distribution.

## Shortening the Architecture Feedback Loop

Eltjo R. Poort, CGI

Combining Architecture with Agile.
Too much architecture leads...
Too much agile leads to... 

Architecture: Up front design, structural stability risk and cost controllability ... 
Agile: experimentation business features local optimization flexibility quick business value

Architecture: look at complexity from a higher level
Agile: lets embrace change.

Balance between: shortening learning cycles, just enough anticipation, decentralize where possible standards where necessary...

Design Decisions.
Two Architecture Feedback loops.

Stakeholder <-Communication Analysis-> Architecture <-Building Experimentation Analysis-> working Systems

Why we want to speed up?
What is architecture: reducing the uncertainty that is present when ever you create something new.
Uncertainty cone is narrowed by research and decision making.
Architecture should also helps to narrow that cone.

Slower feedback loop will slow done the cone narrowing.

What are ways to speed it up?
Architecture decisions are primary deliverable. 
* Say goodbye to The Architecture Document.
* The primary entity is not the document but the decision.
* Finer granularity of artifacts.
* Allow individual decision timing.

Continuous share concerns and decisions.
* Don't be afraid to share unfinished work
* The sooner you share the faster you learn
* You will get feedback, not always positive. 
  The environment should allow for that as well.
  People should feel save to comment.

Invitee immediate feedback from stakeholders


Simplify your architecture documentation template.
* Template bloat kills the feedback loop
* Template gets bloated because every thing ever going wrong is added to the template.
  Templates should not be used as a knowledge repository.
* Create living minimal architecture documentation.
* Look at the goals: Evidence to stakeholder their concerns are being addressed. Storing architecture knowledge for later. Collaborate & communicate architecture decision.
  This goals have a different rhythm.
  Don't put this into the same document.
  A document per goal.
  Arch Decision Repository, Arch Knowledge Repository, Arch View for the stakeholders derive from repositories (snapshot).

Get involved in the delivery.
* Code key parts yourself, that have the most impacts.
* Architecture is a vertical function. 
* Get involved 


## Agility is Inefficient

Klaus Bucka-Lassen

The art of delivering the wrong product four times fast. (fake book)
Delivering faster gives a better chance to learn.
The art if doing twice the work in half the time. (Good book, bad title)

The talk should provoke discussion.
Detect fake agility.
(Becoming agile for the wrong reasons.)

Effectiveness vs. Efficiency.
Doing the right things vs. Doing things right.

Efficiency: looking inwards, defining and optimizing process automate.
Effectiveness: looking outwards, observe the market pivot innovate.

Strategy: effectiveness is to favor over efficiency.
After this you will need to move for efficiency.
But you need to recheck because the marked changes very fast.

> If the ladder is not leaning again the right wall, every step we take just gets us the wrong place faster.

Examples:
* Block Buster - focused on efficiency, poorly let in new information
* Nokia - again very efficient machine but not innovative, wrong type of product, internal structure was unable to adapt to change
* Microsoft - Windows mobile, failed. Phone was cheaper and had a keyboard - not what the marked wanted.
* Volkswagen - vs Tesla, argues for efficiency, new CEO also aims for cost cutting.

Warning signs
1. Budgets & Cost Cutting - the company focuses on efficiency not on the values.
1. Company run by process people, rather than product people
1. High degree of specialization, I over T-shapedness
1. Utilization Maximization: not even efficient.

> The art of delivering twice the value at half the cost.

Understanding the Why and Goals of the stakeholder.

Specialist: 
* Why: is quicker at tasks
* Goal: ensures coverage of all tasks
* Perspective: ...
* Contain: Shadow specialist

Contain under utilization:
* Why personal need to feel as contributors
* Goal: help organization
* Perspective: team members feels under utilized
* Contain: identify lower priority takes outside team team has priority

Effectiveness over Efficiency
