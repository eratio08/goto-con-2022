All software is, is illusions.
Executable fiction.
Some times these error messages reveals more than expected.

Accessing time is a fallible act, just like accessing a file.
Simple Testing can prevent most critical failures.
Motivated reasoning: argue for one thing because you are not able do the other.
A majority of the production failures (77%) can be reproduced by a unit tests.

1998: Yog Town Vessel, data contained a zero where is shouldn't had.
Windows NT was installed and it tried to divide by 0.
The ship was out of commission for 48h.

Using proof to verify programs.
But keeping code simple might be a way better approach.
A loot of bugs are in 'easy' code parts.
A simple division might behave unexpectedly if the numbers are big enough.
An error of assumption.

A perfect program can not not be perfect if executed by an imperfect implementation.

Book: Beautiful Code

> If a programmer can simulate a construct faster than the compiler can implement it... 

The key to correctness is to write simple code.

Book: The making of a fly
There where 2 sellers on amazon that had bot adjusting prices.

Example here showed that 2 perfectly correct software might behave wrong if combined.

The ARIANE 5 rocket disaster, the code was written in Ada but in Fortran style.
A type conversion: clamping the number, was reused from ARIANE 4, because the horizontal velocity was way higher in ARIANE 5.

November 2017, 19 Satellites where failed to be delivered.
The configuration was wrong for the new starting location.
Configuration should be tested as well, as it is a source of errors.
LCE - Latent Configuration Errors.
Configuration are code because they are filled with assumptions.

Given the wrong input one can not expect the correct output.

Excel is a functional reactive system, with a bad type system.
The type system is worse than JavaScript.
Spread sheets are not only used for numbers, e.g. Gene Names.
The naming of genes was changes because of excel.

Climate deniers are utilizing bad software (excel).
The root mean square used was faulty.
Empty cell value was interpreted as 0.
This is why the numbers reported by them where falling and not rising.

An economic model coming from a broken spreadsheet caused a lot a death.
This also caused problems during COVID in the UK.

> History is a vast really warning system.

We should learn from failures to make a difference.
