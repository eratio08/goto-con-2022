Explains what a `Kevlin Henney Screen` is: Public displays showing blue/error screens.

All software is, is illusions.
Executable fiction.
Some times these error messages reveals more than expected.
> The natural enemy of the programmers is the timezone

Accessing time is a fallible act, just like accessing a file.
Simple Testing can prevent most critical failures.
Motivated reasoning: argue for one thing because you are not able do the other.
A majority of the production failures (77%) can be reproduced by a unit tests.

1998: Yog Town Vessel, data contained a zero where is shouldn't had.
Windows NT was installed and it tried to divide by 0.
The ship was out of commission for 48h.

Article: Writing Correct Programs.
Using proof to verify programs.
But keeping code simple might be a way better approach.
A loot of bugs are in 'easy' code parts.
A simple division might behave unexpectedly if the numbers are big enough.
An error of assumption.

> Dijkstra: I have assumed perfect arithmetic's...

A perfect program can not not be perfect if executed by an imperfect implementation.

Book: Beautiful Code

> If a programmer can simulate a construct faster than the compiler can implement it... 

The key to correctness is to write simple code.

Book: The making of a fly
There where 2 sellers on amazon that had bot adjusting prices. 
The book cost about 2M.
Example here showed that 2 perfectly correct software might behave wrong if combined.

In 2016 the pound crashed at midnight, but there was nothing to actually justify it.
It where commuter systems auto correcting.

The ARIANE 5 rocket disaster, the code was written in Ada but in Fortran style.
A type conversion: clamping the number, was reused from ARIANE 4, because the horizontal velocity was way higher in ARIANE 5.

November 2017, 19 Satellites where failed to be delivered.
The configuration was wrong for the new starting location.
Configuration should be tested as well, as it is a source of errors.
LCE - Latent Configuration Errors.
Configuration are code because they are filled with assumptions.

Given the wrong input one can not expect the correct output.

Excel is a functional reactive system, with a bad type system.
The type system is worse than JavaScript.
Spread sheets are not only used for numbers, e.g. Gene Names.
The naming of genes was changes because of excel.

Climate deniers are utilizing bad software (excel).
The root mean square used was faulty.
Empty cell value was interpreted as 0.
This is why the numbers reported by them where falling and not rising.

An economic model coming from a broken spreadsheet caused a lot a death.
This also caused problems during COVID in the UK.

We should learn from failures to make a difference.

 
## A Developer's Introduction to Developing in Web 3

Roy Osherove

The topic is controversial.
Some application of this technology are unethical others are awesome.

Exiting new technology.
New interesting paradigms.
Might allow new types of applications that where hard to build before.

> Build on a blockchain if you **don't** want to have control.

Web 1.0: Read-only.
Web 2.0: Read-Write.
Web 3.0: Read-Write-Own.
You can proof that you own some thing.

Core Concepts:
* Decentralized: ownership is distributed among people
* Permissionless: every one was equal access
* Native payments: crypto currencies, logic has financials build on.
* Trustless: not a person to trust, but to trust the smart contract

Examples:
* Currency (instead of state)
* (partial) Ownership of proof (domains, identity etc..)
* Collateralize Loans (instead of bank)
* Escrow contracts (instead of bank)
* Royalty payments (instead of spotify)

We have not found the 'killer' application yet.

What is a blockchain
1. Distributed Trust
1. Secure
1. Independently Verifiable

A chain of transaction blocks that are cryptographically linked.

Proof of work is harmful.
Proof of stake is the less energy consuming approach.

Etherium as smart contracts in comparison to bitcoin.

Smart Contracts:
* Transaction protocols running on the blockchain (EVM - Etherium Virtual Machine)
* The contracts are stored on the blockchain
* You can not only append
* Changing will require a new version

Solidity:
* variables in a contract will store data on the chain
* calling a method will cost gas and will create a transaction

One could implement a voting system.

What it feels like?
You can not change the code after deployment.
You will have to do extensive testing.
Storage is costly.
Fat Protocols, thin applications.
It's all visible.
Your wallet is your identity.

## Java 2022: Containerized, Serverless, CloudNative

Andrey Adamovich

Automation Guy.
2008 DevOps became mainstream.
Looking at things that where added to the JVM in terms of automation.
Nowadays not real wall between dev and ops.
Wall of new confusion: Dev - DevOps.

Definitions
* cloud native: salable, modern, dynamic environment, loosely coupled resilient, ...
* serverless: not about no server, just the server is not important

12-factor application.
1. 1 code = 1 app
1. isolated dependencies
1. build < release < run
1. backing services - network resources
1. log as event streams
1. config from environment
1. admin commands
1. provided service = port bindings 
1. stateless process
1. concurrent
1. disposable

API-first, Telemetry, Authn and authz, ...

The Monolith
* e.g. Web Sphere
* Deploying apps to a big application server
* hard to optimize
* scale vertical and scale horizontally

Re-design: split up app that do not fit into a single app server.
Allowed to scale independently, because traffic pattern of new parts are different.
Tuning the JVM can be done way more specific to the use case, because it did not need to be general to the monolith.

Splitting up is not scalable limitless because the cognitive load grows.

J2EE -> JEE -> JakartaEE -> MicroProfile.
MicroProfile is more composable and community driven.
App server -> fat jar -> layers app.

> Make JAR not WAR

> Fat-less app

Since JDK 8 can detect container limits, like CPU and Memory limits.
In java 17 the container support got even better.
The JVM will self-tune according to the limits, e.g. how many gc threads.
`-XX:-UseContainerSupport` to disable it.

GC in containers.
1791 - tells the JVM which GC to use. 
Will be serial-stop-the-world if memory is below.
Microsoft was a nice page for which gc to use.

Container images.
base -> runtime -> libs -> code.
With JDK 9 and the module system, we can fine tune runtime size.
We have about ~70 modules in the JDK that can be composed.
In most times we can get rid of unused modules with `jlink`.
A java runtime can be as small as 13MB.
Smaller JVM also decreases attack surface.
Log4Shell could be prevent if the LDAP part was missing from your runtime.

Obersability: Logs, Metrics, Traces.
E.g. Prometheus JMX exporter.
Akka or Spring Actuator.
Jeager for traces.

JFR: Java Flight Recorder.
Free since JDK 11.
You can inject own data with `jfr.Event`.
With JFR you can stream the events since JDK 14.

Serverless: FaaS JVM choices.
Google uses G1...

Graal VM: allows for native images.
Reflection and other memory dynamic features will not work.
Spring Native, Quarkus, Micronaut, Helidon.

JVM allows for many different load-types.
It's still evolving more.
Java has a lot of 'golden path' (spotify term for deploying into production)


## The Psychology of UX

Fabio Pereia

This talk is for humans and for humans who interact with humans.
Shows trailer of the Darron Brown netflix film 'The Push'.

Have you been manipulated recently?
We all haven been.
E.g. Google did by just showing the first page with 10 results.
You make 35.000 decision daily, mostly unconsciously.
We make digital decisions.
How many of the 35k are digital?
A lot.
There will be the meta verse.
Alibaba digital shopping.
We need to be conscious about our decisions.
Augmented Reality in realastate. 

Experiment: Bat and the ball cost 1.10$ the bat is 1$ more expensive than the ball?
How Many cost the ball? 
5cent.
Book: `Thinking. Fast... Slow`.
We often need to think fast.
Because it make us survive.
Stereotyping and shortcuts is what helps us.
Whenever you think about a shortcut it might not be true.

Game: 3 things in 1 Minute.
1. Find someone you do not know
1. Say hi my name is...
1. Ask them what is your dream?

Psychology: has a lot of sub categories.
Cognitive Psychology, is used by behavioral economic.
This can be used to hack human brains/decision making.
Book: Predictable Irrational.
Book: Nudge.
We have bugs about decision making.

We also have bugs in perceptions.
Especially visual perception.

Experiment: 3 types of subscriptions.
1. Only 59 
1. 125  (decoy option)
1. both 125

Options: A (-B) B.
Also works for dating.

Organ donor example, defaulting is very powerful.
Digital default are also very powerful.
Think about your defaults.

Seamless experience.
If you want people to do what you want make it seamless.
Friction makes people stop.
E.g. Amazon go store.

Anticipatory Shipping - Amazon patent.
Sending stuff before you need it.

> I see biases.

iPhone pricing - they use framing and middle option bias.

The IKEA Effect - exaggerate high value. 
If you build something is make you feel like you own it and it's the best result.
Paper: Ikea effect - when labor turn to love.

180 Biases are known/mapped.
Each might be used to influence you.

UX Design - included in every designing.
Digital decision architect.
Designer needs to know human psychology.

There is the role Chief Behavior Officer.
Talk: How behavior economics explains agile.

Book: Digital Nudge.

2 Roles
1. Digital Decision Architect: Nudge for Good
1. Digital Citizen: Be aware that you are nudged

Persuasion <-> Coercion.
What you need <-> What you don't want.

Dark Pattern e.g. Sneak into the basket.
Work only in the digital world.

Attention and Time are the most scares resource in the first world.

Experience: 
* take 3 conscious breath
* ... some BS motivational speech


## Thinking Serverless: From user request to serverless solution

James Beswick, AWS Developer Advocate

Server - How do we use them
* State management, 
* monolithic container for functionality
* One Version one Server
* Server atomic unit of thinking
* Has some management overhead
* Is not efficient most times

Setup for a wordpress hosting - quite complicated.
Serverless aims to take away a lot of the overhead.

Where to start with serverless?
AWS Lambda
* Runs on demand
* Support many runtimes (also custom runtimes)
* Responds to events
* Is stateless
* scales automatically

Best practices
* Avoid lifting and shifting (take server code and drop it in lambda)
* 1 Lambda per purpose
* Keep function small
* Choose the right runtime (Task might differ per tasks)
* Use functions for business logic and plumbing between services
* include security

General approach
* Feature first, will avoid monolithic thinking
* Focus on events, 
* Statelessness, allows for scale
* Data flow, not only a single data store, but many
* Use the services, use services (AWS Services?!)

Serverless is not just Lambda.
API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, Step Functions.
Event Bridge, SnS, Sqs, Kinesis IoTCore, Transcoder.
Other services Recognition Comprehend Textract Transcribe Translate.

Example: Create a serverless app that support a form submitted from a webpage.
API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB. 
Pattern can be applied to any CRUD.

Req: Incoming responses need to be translated.
Listen in Dynamo DB Event and trigger AWS Translate service. 

Req: Aloows user to upload images.
New Lambda that will be called by API Gateway to S3.
The frontend will get a token from the lambda to directly upload to S3.

Req: Email any negative comment immediately.
Use Amazon Comprehend.
New Lambda on dynamo DB Event and interpreted the review.
Send email per SNS.

Req: Only allow signed-in users to posr reviews.
Use Cognito with the API Gateway.

Example: Restaurant reservation app.
Create a severless app to allow customers to reserve a table b sms test message.
Pinpoint -> Lambda -> EventBridge -> Rule -> Lambda -> DynamoDB -> API Gateway <-> Web App.
Not Realtime currently.

Req: Add display showing upcoming reservations in real time.
Rule -> Lambda -> IoT Core (WebSocket Subs) -> Frontend

Req: Speak the name of guest when ready to seat table.
Rule -> Lambda -> Polly (Voice synthesis, async) -> S3 -> Lambda -> IoT Core -> Frontend

Req: Send daily reservation email.
Rule (Scheduled) ->  Lambda -> SnS

Req: Notify legacy app about reservation.
Think about retry when calling the webhook.
Rule -> API Destination (throttles message count, has retry) -> WebHook 

AWS SAM - Serverless Application Model.
CloudFormation translator.
In YAML not as bad as cloud formation.

Experiment with it it's cheap.
Check the serverlessland.com, they have pattern.

Questions:
* When not to use serverless?: If latency is critical.
* How to manage lambda function at scale?: SAM + CDK in CI/CD. 
* How do you share code between functions? Use layers. Layers are immutable. You can use EFS as well.
* Hot to handle the startup time lag (cold start): Pre-warm can help, use async design.
* How to e2e test?: Lambdas are perfect for unit testing. Test against the cloud. Inject event in an event driven setup.
* What about the cost?: Can be extremely cheap. Cost can occurs of use not recommended pattern. Don't call lambdas from lambdas.


## Explainable AI explained for Developers

Joop Snijder, Williem Meints

Auto ML: Training and Deploying ML Model.

Scenario: Tasty Beans.
Company provides Coffee subscription.
One shipping company is good other is not so good.
People are starting to leave.
What the reason for this?
Can be build a model to find people who are likely to cancel with an accuracy of 95%.

Here Azure.

Selected some features from the DB.
* Product Rating
* Delivery Quality
* Who left

 These models should be production ready.
 What does it mean to have a production ready ml model.
 * fair
 * robust
 * secure
 * transparent

Is the results of the model, what should we do.
Try to figure out which feature caused the result.

Why explainable AI?
* Without explanation it's hard to understand the inner workings and ensure the results are correct
* Current a new relation demand explanation of decision and affect people
*  Without knowing why it's hard to derive actions to take

interpretable AI
* white-box models
* explanation from the model
* explainable upfront
* model specific
* e,g. Decision-Tree

explainable AI
* explainable afterwards
* model agnostic

Feature Importance Plot
* Determine the influence of a feature on the output
* Train model on randomized features and see the difference of the output

Can we cluster the customers base on the outcome to determine actions?

Global vs Local. 
For each prediction explain why - this is a local explanation.
Feature importance plot is a global explanation.

Segmentation of the customers.
With global explanation of a segment can help to derive business actions.
Because it's not feasible to target the individual.

Tabular data can be explained well with importance plot.
Another approach is prediction breakdown, explain the model step by step.

Other types of data might be natural language or commuter vision.

Questions
* How to choose the model to get a explainable models?: Certain models might be more explainable.
* How can explainable be helpful if the domain is not easily explainable?: Feature engineering has to be done proper. You need to know what which feature actually means.
* What does it mean for a model to be robust?: Model that can not be tricked easily is robust. Quality and Security of the model. Repeatable results.


## Cloud-Native Progressive Delivery

Matt Turner

How does cloud native enabled this?
In the beginning there is a process.
Then there was the 12 factor-app.
Process was put into a container.
Separate build and run.
Microsevices with Gateway and adapters microservice service.
Kubernetes to for orchestration.
Service Mesh e.g. Istio.
Metrics from K8s and Istio for prometheus or others.
Service Levels: SLA SLO SLI.

Current Deployments.
We all got CI/CD.
Deployment - taking artifact and run it.
Continuous Deploying - do the same continuously.
Continuous Release - exposing new deployments to the user.
Deploy != Release.
Contract: each commit creates a new image and commits it to the registry.
Git Ops.
Deployments are triggered by new images. 
Sending traffic to the new pod is the risky part.
Initially do not send traffic to the container.
We could use header to allow traffic with certain header to do some acceptance testing.
Use automation here possibly.
Non functional testing like SLO.
Now send traffic to the new pod but do not send responses to the user. 
Validate responses.
Software is exposed to the user but the user is not exposed to the software.
Release. Send tiny bit of traffic to the new release.
The controller can handle all this automatically with metrics.

Github for CD, flux for watching the image registry, Flagger progressive deployment operator.

Image policy can define which versions will be released.

Questions:
* What about serverless? The principals possible also apply.
* Who to handle state full requests? Cloud Native approach: handle state different. Event sourcing, tag with origin and filter out. Or use adapter to drop requests.
* Istio vs Linkerd? Both are fine. Flagger can work with SMI implementations.
* Can this work with ECS? Maybe. Pure EC2 yes with Istio.
* Are gitops tools production ready? Yes, FLUX and Argo Rollout and Argo Events is also very solid.


## The Importance of Laughter

Aino Vonge Corry, Ph.D

Denmark one of the happiest people.
Reason for that, very low expectations.
Why do we want to listen?
* You want to be funny
* Your are interested in why people laugh and what do they laugh at.
* Funniest yoke in the world

> The life is lived forwards but you have to understand it backwards.

Facilitation, laughing helps in difficult situations. 

The frontal lobe will decide if you find something funny.
The physical importance of laughter is well researched.
It's a workout.
It's an anti-depressant because it raises serotonin and endorphin and dopamine.

The psychological importance of laughter.
Defused intensity so you can use your intellect.

Logos - what your are saying.
Pathos - how exited you are.
Ethos - who (they think) you are.
You need 2 out of 3 for presenting.

Use self deprecating humor at the beginning.

We laugh to show that we understand.
We show that we get that joke.
A social laughter, belonging to a group.
Jokes about a common enemy.

Laughing can be used push people apart, like bullying.
Humor can be very harmful.
Jokes are never just a joke.
They stem from a thought that was there in the first place.

Banter - playful teasing.

Can be use to pull people together.
Funny people are perceived as smarter.

Two types of laughter.
1. the natural, being (mentally) tickled
1. the post laughter, the social laughter

Two kinds of smiles.
1. Fake (Brodmanns are 24)
1. Real (Brodmanns are 4)
This can be seen by looking in the screen.

We are mimicking the opponents expressions.
People with botox injections have less empathy.

Richard Feynman: Kick of the discovery.
For each words said you will have a sub-tree of possible outcomes.
When ever the outcome was not expected it might be funny.

How to be funny?
Timing is everything.
Some jokes are only funny the first time.
* Surprise
* Belonging 
* Clever
* Common animosity
* ...
